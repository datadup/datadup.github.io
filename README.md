# Data DUPLEX
Communication with data and data visualizations

### Inspiration:
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)) a duplex communication system is a point-to-point system composed of two or more connected parties or devices that can communicate with one another in both directions. A full-duplex (FDX) system, or sometimes called double-duplex, allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows this to happen simultaneously.

Data visualizations can act as both one-way communication and two-way communication, where communication in both directions is accomplished through in intaractive charts and maps. Can we also achieve full-duplex communication i data visualization i.e. simultaneous communication? Maybe through two way data binding, asynchronous methods and Parallelization.

... more comming soon.
